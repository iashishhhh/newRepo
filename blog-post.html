                    New York City. The New York Times covers domestic, national, and international news, and publishes
                    opinion pieces, investigative reports, and reviews. As one of the longest-running newspapers in the
                    United States, the Times serves as one of the country's newspapers of record. As of 2023, The New
                    York Times is the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States, with 296,330
                    print subscribers. The Times has 8.83 million online subscribers, the most of any newspaper in the
                    United States. The New York Times is published by The New York Times Company; since 1896, the
                    company has been chaired by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, whose current chairman and the paper's
                    publisher is A. G. Sulzberger.
                </p>
                <p>The Times was founded as the conservative New-York Daily Times in 1851, and came to national
                    recognition in the 1870s with its aggressive coverage of corrupt politician William M. Tweed.
                    Following the Panic of 1893, Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs gained a controlling interest
                    in the company. In 1935, Ochs was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who began a
                    push into European news. Sulzberger's son-in-law Arthur Ochs became publisher in 1963, adapting to a
                    changing newspaper industry and introducing radical changes. The New York Times was involved in the
                    landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, which restricted the ability
                    of public officials to sue the media for defamation.

                        Henry Jarvis Raymond
                        and George Jones.[4] The Times experienced significant circulation, particularly among
                        conservatives; New-York Tribune publisher Horace Greeley praised the New-York Daily Times.[5]
                        During the American Civil War, Times correspondents gathered information directly from
                        Confederate states.[6] In 1869, Jones inherited the paper from Raymond,[7] who had changed its
                        name to The New-York Times.[8] Under Jones, the Times began to publish a series of articles
                        criticizing Tammany Hall political boss William M. Tweed, despite vehement opposition from other
                        New York newspapers.[9] In 1871, The New-York Times published Tammany Hall's accounting books;
                        Tweed was tried in 1873 and sentenced to twelve years in prison. </span>

                        <p> The Israeli military began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, targeting what it said
                            early
                            Tuesday was Hezbollah military infrastructure in villages close to the Israel-Lebanon
                            border,
                            the first such incursion by Israel into its northern neighbor’s territory in nearly two
                            decades.

                            Israeli leaders approved the plans late Monday night to send in troops, according to three
                            Israeli officials. And in a statement issued shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday, the military
                            said
                            that Israeli troops had begun crossing the border “a few hours ago” in order to target sites
                            that “pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel.”

                            The officials said the plans involved operating in a narrow strip of land that lines the
                            northern side of the border. The invasion force would consist of small groups of commandos
                            accompanied by air cover, as well as artillery shells fired from Israel, the officials said.
                            The
                            officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters.

                            The invasion followed intense Israeli strikes across Lebanon over the past two weeks that
                            have
                            killed hundreds of people. Israel is attempting to force a conclusion to a war that began
                            last
                            October, when Hezbollah started firing toward Israeli positions in solidarity with its ally
                            Hamas.
                            Hezbollah said on Monday that its forces would confront Israeli troops if they carried out a
                            full invasion. “We will confront any possibility, and we are ready if the Israelis decide to
                            enter by land,” Sheikh Naim Qassem, deputy to Hezbollah’s slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah,
                            said
                            in a televised statement. “The forces of the resistance are ready for a ground engagement.”
                            The group denied that its fighting power or arsenal had been significantly damaged in recent
                            weeks by Israel’s bombardments, which have killed hundreds of people, including civilians.

                            Later, Hezbollah said in a statement that it had targeted Israeli troop movements across
                            from
                            Lebanese border towns. Rocket sirens were sounded in a number of northern Israeli border
                            communities, including where the Israeli military has announced a “closed military zone.”

                            Israeli commando units had made brief incursions into Lebanon in recent days to prepare for
                            a
                            possible wider ground invasion, according to Israeli officers and officials as well as a
                            senior
                            Western official.

                            The raids were focused on gathering intelligence about Hezbollah positions close to the
                            Israeli-Lebanese border, as well as identifying Hezbollah tunnels and military
                            infrastructure,
                            in order to attack them from the air or the ground, the seven Israeli and Western officials
                            said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military
                            matter.
                            The Israeli military declined to comment.

                            Israel’s security cabinet met on Monday evening to discuss whether and when to launch a
                            major
                            ground operation in southern Lebanon. Israel occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000,
                            and
                            briefly invaded in 2006 during a monthlong war with Hezbollah. It also invaded southern
                            Lebanon
                            in 1978.

                            Before midnight, loud explosions could be heard and flashes of light could be seen in
                            Dahiya,
                            the densely populated area just south of Beirut where the Israeli military had issued fresh
                            evacuation warnings. The Israeli military had called on Lebanese in and around three
                            building
                            complexes in the Dahiya to evacuate the areas, saying they were near Hezbollah targets.

                            Israeli officials previously told the Biden administration that the commando units were
                            conducting “limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border” between
                            Israel and Lebanon, Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesman, told reporters on
                            Monday.</p>

                        <h2 class="headline  ">Israeli Military Announces Ground Invasion of Southern Lebanon </h2>
                        <p> The Israeli military began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon,
                            targeting what it said early
                            Tuesday was Hezbollah military infrastructure in villages close to the Israel-Lebanon
                            border,
                            the first such incursion by Israel into its northern neighbor’s territory in nearly two
                            decades.

                            Israeli leaders approved the plans late Monday night to send in troops, according to three
                            Israeli officials. And in a statement issued shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday, the military
                            said
                            that Israeli troops had begun crossing the border “a few hours ago” in order to target sites
                            that “pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel.”

                            The officials said the plans involved operating in a narrow strip of land that lines the
                            northern side of the border. The invasion force would consist of small groups of commandos
                            accompanied by air cover, as well as artillery shells fired from Israel, the officials said.
                            The
                            officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters.

                            The invasion followed intense Israeli strikes across Lebanon over the past two weeks that
                            have
                            killed hundreds of people. Israel is attempting to force a conclusion to a war that began
                            last
                            October, when Hezbollah started firing toward Israeli positions in solidarity with its ally
                            Hamas.
                            Hezbollah said on Monday that its forces would confront Israeli troops if they carried out a
                            full invasion. “We will confront any possibility, and we are ready if the Israelis decide to
                            enter by land,” Sheikh Naim Qassem, deputy to Hezbollah’s slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah,
                            said
                            in a televised statement. “The forces of the resistance are ready for a ground engagement.”
                            The group denied that its fighting power or arsenal had been significantly damaged in recent
                            weeks by Israel’s bombardments, which have killed hundreds of people, including civilians.

                            Later, Hezbollah said in a statement that it had targeted Israeli troop movements across
                            from
                            Lebanese border towns. Rocket sirens were sounded in a number of northern Israeli border
                            communities, including where the Israeli military has announced a “closed military zone.”
